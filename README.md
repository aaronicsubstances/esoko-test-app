## Instructions for testing

   1. Create .env and .env.test files besides the .env.example and .env.test.example files, and configure them as needed. *NB: data in test db tables is deleted each time `npm  test` is run, so you may want the test db to be different from the development db.*

   2. Use `npm run reset-db` to reset the database, and populate its first collection with data from the CSV sample file.

   3. use `npm start` to run application

   4. use `npm test` to run the integration tests of the application. Due to time constraints, the integration tests are intended to be demonstrative rather than exhaustive.
